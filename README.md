# Job Posting Analysis Project 

The project utilises a dataset containing detailed information about job postings, including job titles, company names, locations, salary ranges, and the required skillset. These files were analysed to identify trends in job demand, salary expectations, and geographic distribution of opportunities. The insights derived from this analysis aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the Data Science job market in 2023.

## Background

The databases used in this project was provided through __Luke Barousse__'s online resources - available via his website [here](https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql). 

## Project Goals

By querying the databases, this project ultimately sought answers to five questions concerning Data Science job postings: 

1. What are the highest-paying data scientist job postings in the UK? 
2. What are the skills most often required for the highest-paying job postings in the UK?
3. What are the top skills most sought after, among all data science jobs in the UK?
4. What are the average salaries for data science job postings requiring each skill in the UK? 
5. What are the optimal skills for data science job postings in the UK, in terms of both associated average salary, and  demand? 

## Tools Used

The following software resources were required to answer these questions: 

- **PostgreSQL** was used as the relational database management system, to store and manage the data. 
- **SQL** was used to query and manipulate the data. 
- **pgAdmin 4** was the GUI by which the PostgreSQL database was interacted with,
